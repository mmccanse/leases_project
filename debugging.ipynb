Additionally, ASC 842 requires lessors to apply specific guidance in ASC 606 to their leasing transactions, particularly for the allocation of consideration in the contract. The FASB clarified that existing unmodified contracts do not need to revisit the allocation of contract consideration to lease components upon the adoption of ASC 842, except when lease classification changes. Overall, the alignment between ASC 842 and ASC 606 aims to provide consistency and clarity in lease and revenue recognition accounting practices.\")]"

Your responses should be similar.\\n\\nQuestion: How do I determine the different lease components?\\n\\nAnswer: Lease components are elements of the arrangement that provide the customer with the right to use an \\n            identified asset. An entity should consider the right to use an underlying asset to be a separate lease component \\n            if the following 2 conditions are met: 1. Lessee can benefit from the ROU asset either on its own or together with \\n            other readily available resources and 2. The ROU is neither highly dependent on; nor highly interrelated with the other \\n            ROU(s) in the contract. You can find additional information in the following reference documents. References: \\n            KPMG-leaseshandbook section 4.1, PWC-leasesguide0124, section 2.4, EY-financial-reporting-developments-lease-accounting, section 1.4\\n\\nQuestion: I am a lessor, how do I account for lease modifications?\\n\\nAnswer: Several questions must be answered to determine how to appropriately account for lease modifications for \\n            a lessor. Is the modified contract a lease, or does it contain a lease? If yes, does the modification result in a \\n            separate contract? If yes, account for two separate contracts: the unmodified original contract, and a separate \\n            contract accounted for in the same manner as any other new lease. If the modification does not result in a separate \\n            contract, remeasure and reallocate the remaining consideration in the contract, reassess the lease classification at \\n            the modification effective date, and account for any initial direct costs, lease incentives, and other paymetns made to \\n            or by the lessor. Whether or not the lease classification changes, and how it changes drives the appropriate accounting. \\n            You can find additional information in the following reference documents.

Is the modified contract a lease, or does it contain a lease? If yes, does the modification result in a \\n            separate contract? If yes, account for two separate contracts: the unmodified original contract, and a separate \\n            contract accounted for in the same manner as any other new lease. If the modification does not result in a separate \\n            contract, remeasure and reallocate the remaining consideration in the contract, reassess the lease classification at \\n            the modification effective date, and account for any initial direct costs, lease incentives, and other paymetns made to \\n            or by the lessor. Whether or not the lease classification changes, and how it changes drives the appropriate accounting. \\n            You can find additional information in the following reference documents.

      "The disclosure requirements under ASC 842 aim to provide users of financial statements with qualitative and quantitative information to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For lessees, the disclosure should cover information about leases, significant judgments made in applying the lease accounting requirements, and the amounts recognized in the financial statements related to leases. This includes a general description of leases, the basis for determining variable lease payments, options to extend or terminate leases, and options for a lessee to purchase the underlying asset. \n",

      "Lessees should also disclose significant assumptions and judgments made in applying the lease accounting requirements. This may involve determining whether a contract contains a lease, allocating consideration between lease and non-lease components, and estimating the amount expected to derive from the underlying asset following the end of the lease term. \n",
