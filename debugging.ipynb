ASC 842 aligns certain concepts with ASC 606, such as determining whether the transfer of an asset is a sale in a sale and leaseback transaction. Additionally, ASC 842 requires lessors to apply specific guidance in ASC 606 to their leasing transactions, particularly for the allocation of consideration in the contract. The FASB clarified that existing unmodified contracts do not need to revisit the allocation of contract consideration to lease components upon the adoption of ASC 842, except when lease classification changes. Overall, the alignment between ASC 842 and ASC 606 aims to provide consistency and clarity in lease and revenue recognition accounting practices.\")]"
