Its leases (as described in paragraphs 842 -30-50-3(a), 842 -30-50-4, and 842 -30-50-7) \\nb.

All rights reserved.  How the standard works  \\nThe disclosure objective in Topic 842 is to provide financial statement users \\nsufficient information to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash \\nflows arising from leases. To achieve that objective, lessees and lessors \\ndisclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions.  \\n \\n \\nThis generally will result in increased information being disclosed as compared \\nto Topic 840. Accordingly, entities will need to evaluate whether they have \\nappropriate systems, processes and internal controls to capture the complete \\nand accurate lease data necessary to prepare the financial statement notes.  \\nFor a discussion of transition disclosures, see section 13A .2.5 (if electing the \\neffective date transition method) or 13B.2.5 (if electing the comparative transition method) .\\n\\nLeases  967 \\n12.

Information about the nature of its leases, including:  \\n1. A general description of those leases  \\n2. The basis and terms and conditions on which variable lease \\npayments  are determined  \\n3. The existence and terms and c onditions of options to extend or \\nterminate the lease  \\n4.

Your responses should be similar.\\n\\n\\nQuestion: How do I determine the different lease components?\\n\\nAnswer: Lease components are elements of the arrangement that provide the customer with the right to use an \\n            identified asset. An entity should consider the right to use an underlying asset to be a separate lease component \\n            if the following 2 conditions are met: 1. Lessee can benefit from the ROU asset either on its own or together with \\n            other readily available resources and 2. The ROU is neither highly dependent on; nor highly interrelated with the \\n            other ROU(s) in the contract. References: KPMG-leaseshandbook section 4.1, PWC-leasesguide0124, section 2.4, \\n            EY-financial-reporting-developments-lease-accounting, section 1.4\\n\\n\\nQuestion: I am a lessor, how do I account for lease modifications?\\n\\nAnswer: Several questions must be answered to determine how to appropriately account for lease modifications for \\n            a lessor. Is the modified contract a lease, or does it contain a lease? If yes, does the modification result in a \\n            separate contract? If yes, account for two separate contracts: the unmodified original contract, and a separate \\n            contract accounted for in the same manner as any other new lease. If the modification does not result in a separate \\n            contract, remeasure and reallocate the remaining consideration in the contract, reassess the lease classification at \\n            the modification effective date, and account for any initial direct costs, lease incentives, and other paymetns made to \\n            or by the lessor. Whether or not the lease classification changes, and how it changes drives the appropriate accounting. \\n            References: EY - Financial Reporting Developments: lease accounting, section 5.6, PWC - Leases Guide, section 5.6, \\n            KPMG - Leases Handbook, section 7.6\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion: What are the disclosure requirements under ASC 842?\\nAnswer: ', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'n': 1, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

      "For lessors, the disclosure requirements are similar and include information about the nature of their leases, significant assumptions and judgments made in applying the lease accounting requirements, and the amounts recognized in the financial statements relating to those leases. Lessors should also consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective and aggregate or disaggregate disclosures to ensure that useful information is not obscured.\n",

      "Overall, the disclosure requirements under ASC 842 necessitate that lessees and lessors provide detailed insights into their lease transactions, including lease terms, judgments made, and financial impacts. This ensures transparency and helps stakeholders make informed decisions based on the information presented in the financial statements. It is important for entities to carefully assess their systems, processes, and internal controls to capture complete and accurate lease data for disclosure purposes. \n",
